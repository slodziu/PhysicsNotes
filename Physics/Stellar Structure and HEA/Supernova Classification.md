SN classified based on the observational properties, happen in more massive stars after [[Post Main-Sequence Stellar Evolution]]. 

**Type I:
- NO H lines in spectra
- **Type Ia:
	- Si2 lines present
	- Result of white dwarf merger or accretion to surpass Chandrasekhar limit
		- Single-Degenerate (SD) is the *old* picture of accretion until $1.4M_\odot$. WD destroyed but companion star should survive -> not observed so disfavoured.
		- Double-Degenerate (DD) is a model of WD merger.
- **Type Ib:
	- NO Si2 present, but He1 still present in spectrum.
- **Type Ic:
	- NO Si2 or He1 present in spectrum.
**Type II:
- H lines present
- Result of core collapse of massive $>8M_\odot$ stars
