- Active galaxies are ones in which significant fraction of emission is non-thermal (not coming from stars or ISM), make up about ~3% of galaxies.
- AGN is the the central few pc of the galaxy, characterised by emission of enormous amounts of [[Energy]] and often jets of relativistic material.


Usually classified into:
- **Quasars**->Bright, compact centres outshine rest of galaxy. Nearly featureless spectrum from radio to X-Rays, broad emission lines in optical
- **Radio Galaxies**-> Look like elliptical galaxies in optical, but very luminous in radio. Emission comes from nucleus and/or pair of lobes extending to ~100s of kpc. They are subclassified into FR types:
	- **FR 1**-> Brightest in centre but less luminous than FR 2. Jets present but less collimated than FR 2.
	- **FR2**-> Powerful, collimated jets, often terminating in hotspots, brightest in their lobes.
- **Seyfert Galaxies**-> Spiral galaxies with bright unresolved cores. Strong optical emission lines from excitation and ionisation states too high to be produced in stars. Weak or no radio emission. Often involved in mergers with other galaxies.
- **Blazars** -> Extremely luminous and *variable* sources dominated by **synchrotron** radiation. Weak emission lines, swamped by synchrotron continuum.

Another type of classification is the ratio of radio to non-radio emission:
- **Radio-loud **-> 10x brighter in radio than optical, almost exclusive in ellipticals.
- **Radio-quiet* -> otherwise
