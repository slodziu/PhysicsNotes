- Carnot Engine is a 'perfect' heat engine which converts [[Heat|heat]] into [[Work|work]].

- Consists of 4 steps:
	- 1. [[Constraints in Thermodynamics|Isothermal]] expansion at $T_h$ 
	- 2. [[Constraints in Thermodynamics|Adiabatic]] expansion (gas cools to $T_c$)
	- 3. Isothermal compression at $T_c$
	- 4. Adiabatic compression (gas heats to $T_h$)

Total change in [[Internal Energy|internal energy]] $\Delta U =0$ after cycle, [[Work|work done]] by system $W = \int pdV$.

The efficiency of Carnot cycle is:
$$\eta = 1-\frac{Q_c}{Q_h}=1-\frac{T_c}{T_h}$$
by the [[Carnot Relation]].
