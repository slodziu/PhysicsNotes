[[Laws of Thermodynamics|First Law]] becomes
$$dU=TdS-pdV+\mu dN,$$
So chemical potential is defined as
$$\mu=(\frac{\partial U}{\partial N})_{S,V}$$
Can add this to other [[Thermodynamic Potentials]] like
$F=U-TS \to dF=-pdV-SdT+\mu dN$

Important for Gibbs Free energy as $\mu = (\partial G/\partial N)_{p,T}$ but $p,T$ are [[Extensive and Intensive variables|intensive]] and for a homogenous system $G \propto N$, so
$$\mu = \frac GN$$
Therefore, for a homogenous system chemical potential is the Gibbs energy per particle.

Physically, if $T_b >T_a$, heat flows from B to A and $\mu_B > \mu_A$ particles flow from B to A.
