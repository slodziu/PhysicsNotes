- Can cool gases using [[Constraints in Thermodynamics|adiabatic]] expansion e.g. using a piston with braked flywheel

- In JT expansion, system is isolated so adiabatic changes
- Piston in LHS chamber maintains constant pressure $p_1$
- Piston in RHS moves to the right to maintain pressure $p_2$
- Force exerted $F = p_1 A$, work done on gas 1: $W=p_1AL_1=p_1V_1$; on gas 2 $W=p_2V_2$
- [[Internal Energy|Internal energy]] initially $U_1$, afterwards $U_2$; since adiabatic, $dQ=0, dU=dW$
- $U_2-U1=p_1V_1-p_2V_2 \to U_1+=p_1V_1=U_2+p_2V_2$
- This is **enthalpy**, which is conserved here $H_1=H_2$.

Amount of cooling dependent on the **Joule-Tomson Coefficient**:
$$\mu_{JT}=(\frac{\partial T}{\partial p})_H=\frac{1}{C_p}[T(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T})_p-V]$$
- For cooling, need $\mu_{JT} >0$ 
- For [[Ideal Gas]], $\mu_{JT}=0$
- **Inversion Temperature** is the temperature below which cooling occurs which happens when
$$(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T})_p=\frac{V}{T}$$
