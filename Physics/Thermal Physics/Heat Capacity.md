- The amount of [[Heat|heat]] that must be added to the gas to change its temperature by a given amount.
$$C_X=(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial T})_X$$
Where $X$ is the [[Constraints in Thermodynamics|constraint]] being held constant.

If the [[Equation of the State|state equation]] is known, can divide the [[Internal Energy|internal energy expression]] by $dT$ to obtain the heat capacity for a given constraint.
