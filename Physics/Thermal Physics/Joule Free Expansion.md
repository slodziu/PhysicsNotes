- Initially all gas on the left
- System is **isolated**
- Valve opened **suddenly** so not reversible
- Walls rigid, so gas does no [[Work|work]] on surroundings
- Since [[Entropy|entropy]] is a [[Functions of the state|function of the state]], it is path independent:

- Define new, [[Constraints in Thermodynamics|isothermal]] path
- For an [[Ideal Gas Properties|ideal gas]], $\Delta U=0$ 
- $dS =\frac{pdV}{T}$ , so $\Delta S = \int_V^{2V} nR/V dV=nR \ln{2}$.

The change in temperature of a gas in Joule expansion is defined as:
$$\mu_J= (\frac{\partial T}{\partial V})_U$$
For example, for [[General Gas - Van der Waals equation|Van der Waals]] equation $\mu_J = -2an/3RV^2$.
