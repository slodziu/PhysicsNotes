Links thermodynamical variables which are dependent on each other in a form
$$f(x,y,z) = 0$$
E.g. the ideal gas: $$pV=nRT \Rightarrow pV-nRT=0 = f(p,V,T)$$
- This allows the use of differentiation to relate variables
- Can always rewrite the [[Internal Energy|internal energy]] as a function of two of the variables:
$$U=U(p,V) \; \text{or} \;U=U(p,T) \; \text{or} \; U=U(T,V)$$
