- Considering a box of length $L$, with single particle connected to a thermal reservoir (other particles)
- Only certain values of [[Angular Wavenumber|wavevector]] $k$
- This quantisation comes from [[Period|periodic]] boundary conditions
- $E = \hbar ^2k^2/2m$

- Number of $k$-states per $n$-dimensional volume is $(L/2\pi)^n$ 
- Then density of states
$$D(k)dk=4\pi k^2dk(\frac{L}{2\pi})^n$$
