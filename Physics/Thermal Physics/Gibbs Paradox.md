- Consider the setup
![[Pasted image 20240301171940.png]]
- if A and B are indistinguishable, then after taking out the partition, no change in [[Entropy]]
- if A and B are **distinguishable** then $\Delta S=2Nk_B\ln{2}$ by [[Sackur-Tetrode Equation]]
- So change in entropy depends on if A,B different **but not how much different**
- So if there is a property which we cannot measure, so that A,B appear identical, would entropy change if we suddenly become able to measure it?
	- The answer is **yes**, entropy depends on our knowledge of the system!
	- Newfound entropy can be thought of as energy needed to separate the two back into groups of the new property
