- Given enough time, the system will explore all possible microstates and will spend an equal amount of time in each of them
- This means that isolated system in [[Thermal Equilibrium|thermal equilibrium]] will adopt the macrostate with the most microstates.
	- This is [[Laws of Thermodynamics|2nd Law]] $dS \geq 0$ maximising entropy
