- [[Fermions]]:
	- $\frac 12$-integer spin particles (in units of [[Reduced Planck's Constant]])
	- electrons, protons, neutrons
	- Total [[Wavefunction]] is antisymmetric w.r.t. particle exchange s.t.
	- $$\Psi(a,b)=-\Psi(b,a)$$
	- this means that we can **only have one fermion in any single quantum state**
	- This leads to the [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]] 
- [[Bosons]]:
	- Integer spin particles
	- photons, phonons
	- for a system of Bose particles:
	- $$\Psi(a,b)=\Psi(b,a)$$
	- therefore there are **no** restrictions on number of Bose particles
