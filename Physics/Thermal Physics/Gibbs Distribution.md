- [[Statistical Ensemble|Grand Canonical Ensemble]] can be considered as
	- each atom separately as a subsystem
	- or whole gas as a system, each energy level is a sum of energy levels of each atom

- The probability of being in any state $i$ (Gibbs distribution) is similar to [[Boltzmann Distribution]]:
$$P_i=\frac{e^{\beta(\mu N_i-E_i)}}{Z_G}$$
	where $Z_G$ is the [[Partition Function|Grand Partition Function]]

## Average occupancy of states
$$<N>=k_BT(\frac{\partial\ln{Z_G}}{\partial \mu})_{\beta},$$
where $\mu$ is the [[Chemical Potential]]
