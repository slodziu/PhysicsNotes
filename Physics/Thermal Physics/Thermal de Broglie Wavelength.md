- It is the characteristic size of system where quantum effects become important
- Using [[Partition Function|partition function]] and [[Density of States|density of states]] can derive a thermal wavelength:
$$\lambda_T=\frac{h}{\sqrt{2\pi k_BTm}}$$
- for instance, for electrons, $\lambda_T=3\times 10^{-10}m$, $T=6\times 10^6K\to$ electrons in solid are always in [[Quantum Physics|quantum regime]] 
- Can compare this to the actual [[de Broglie Wavelength]] ($\lambda=h/\sqrt{3k_BTm}$)
