Assumptions:
- Only translational degrees of freedom
- Each molecule has unique velocity state
- Allowed velocities uniformly distributed in velocity space
- Each molecule connected to thermal bath (made up of other particles)

Velocity distribution:
$$P(v_x)\propto e^{-\beta mv_x^2/2}$$
- This needs to be [[Normalisation|normalised]]
- Introduce speed distribution $v=|\vec{v}|$
- Then the speed distribution function:
$$f(v)=\frac{4}{\sqrt\pi}(\frac{\beta m}{2})^{3/2}v^2e^{-\beta v^2m/2}$$
From this can obtain:
- Average speed $<v^2>=3kT/m$
- Average KE $<E>=3kT/2$
- Pressure $pV=NkT=nRT$
