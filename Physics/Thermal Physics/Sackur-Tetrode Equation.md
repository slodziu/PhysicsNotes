- An equation for [[Entropy|entropy]] involving the [[Partition Function|partition function for many particles]] and the [[Thermal de Broglie Wavelength]]
$$S=k_BN[\ln{(\frac{V}{\lambda_T^3N})}+\frac 52]$$
- It is **inconsistent** with [[Laws of Thermodynamics|3rd Law]] as $T\to 0, S\to -\infty$ instead of $S\to0$
	- this is due to double occupancy
