**0th Law**:
- If two systems are separately in [[Thermal Equilibrium|equilibrium]] with a third body, all 3 bodies have the same temperature
- This formalises the measurement of temperature using a thermometer.
**1st Law**:
- [[Energy]] is conserved.
- [[Heat]] and [[Work|work]] are are both forms of energy
$$\def\dbar{{Â¯\mkern-12mu d}} dU = \dbar Q+\dbar W $$
- Where $U$ is the [[Internal Energy|internal energy]], $\dbar Q$ (heat supplied **to** system) and $\dbar W$ (work done **on** system) are both [[Inexact Differentials|inexact differentials]], but $dU$ is an [[Exact Differentials|exact differential]] and hence it is a [[Functions of the state|state function]].
- Using the definition of [[Entropy|entropy]] and [[Work|work]] done on gas, can rewrite the 1st Law in terms of state functions: $$dU = TdS-pdV$$
**2nd Law**:
- No process is possible whose sole result is the complete conversion of heat into work.
- [[Heat]] can be converted to heat with 100% efficiency, but **not** the reverse.
- No process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from **colder to hotter** body.
- Alternatively, stating that **entropy can never decrease**:
$$dS \geq0$$
- Considering the Universe as an isolated system, one can see that entropy of the Universe will always increase
**3rd Law**:
- At absolute zero, all reactions take place with no change in [[Entropy|entropy]] 
- Any system must have only one available state at $T=0$ ($S=k\ln{\Omega}, S=0 \to \Omega = 1$)
- It is **impossible** to cool something to absolute zero in finite amount of steps
