- Large number of virtual copies of a system which are all the same but configured in random ways
- Ensemble average = average state of all virtual ensembles

- **Statistical Ensemble** is the [[probability density function|probability distribution]] over all possible states of the system
- To obtain this can either
	- Take a single system and follow it over a long time so it goes through all configurations
	- Take a number of identical but randomly configured systems and take ensemble average

**Types of ensemble:
- Micro-canonical, fixed $U,V,N$
- Canonical connected to heat reservoir, fixed $V,N,T$
- Grand-canonical connected to heat+particle reservoir, fixed $V,T,\mu$

**Principle of equal equilibrium probability:**
- When a thermally isolated system comes into [[Thermal Equilibrium|thermal equilibrium]], then the state probabilities of any set of mutually accessible states become equal
	- in a micro-canonical ensemble, $P_i = \frac 1\Omega$.
