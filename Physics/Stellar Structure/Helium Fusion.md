- Converts $3\;^4He\to^{12}C+\gamma$  (triple alpha reaction)
- After core hydrogen is exhausted via [[Hydrogen Burning]], helium is fused:
$$^4He+^4He \rightleftharpoons \;^8Be$$
- Be highly unstable and so decays back to helium
	- But a small concentration can build up to allow for further alpha capture
$$^4He+^8Be\to^{12}C^*\to^{12}C+\gamma$$
- Carbon only forms thanks to *resonant state*
- VERY strong temperature dependence in [[Energy]] generation $\varepsilon_{3\alpha}\propto T^{40}$ 
- Further alpha captures can happen with C and O
