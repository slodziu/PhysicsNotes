For *stability* :
$$\nabla_{rad}<\nabla_{ad},$$
where $\nabla_{rad}$ is the radiative temperature-pressure gradient $\propto \kappa \frac{L}{M}$ 
and $\nabla_{ad}$ is the adiabatic temperature-pressure gradient

- So convection occurs when
	- Large $\kappa$ - opacity, outer envelope of cool stars (Sun), leads to convective envelopes
	- Large $L/M$ light-mass ratio -> cores of high mass stars convective
	- Small $\nabla_{ad}$ -> surface layers where H and He partly ionised
