**LOW MASS STARS** ($0.8M_{\odot}<M<2M_{\odot}$):
- Develop a *degenerate He core*, undergo a Helium flash.
- Develop CO cores, end lives as white dwarfs.

Stages of evolution:
- Core H exhaustion
- Subgiant branch
	- Degenerate He core develops
	- Envelope becomes convective
- Convective envelope deepens -> **FIRST DREDGE UP**
	- Pulls CN-cycled material to surface
- H shell burning
	-  Inert He core grows in mass
	- Mass loss happens
- **HELIUM FLASH** at $0.45M_\odot$, core T enough for He fusion
	- Core is DEGENERATE - P independent of T
	- Runaway nuclear burning happens, huge energy generation happens
	- Energy goes towards lifting degeneracy
- Star settles into quiescent convective core He burning
- Horizontal branch -> in globular clusters low M stars form this branch
	- Stars move towards hotter T when they have less mass in envelopes
- Asymptotic Giant Branch
	- Early-AGB: Starts at the end of core He burning -> left with an inert CO core, shift to shell He burning, gradually adds mass to CO core, L increases as core grows
	- Thermally-Pulsing AGB: As He-shell burns, it runs out of fuel creating a H-He discontinuity, outer layers contract heating the H shell, H-burn starts again, making new He -> **double shell burning phase** -> NOT stable
	- Periodic runaway He burning, He shell flashes or THERMAL PULSES
	- Strong mass loss terminates the stars' evolution




**INTERMEDIATE MASS STARS** ($2M_{\odot}<M<8M_{\odot}$):
- Develop *non-degenerate He cores*, smooth transition to [[Helium Fusion]]
- Develop CO cores, end lives as white dwarfs.

Stages of evolution:
- End of MS, H is exhausted -> shell hydrogen burning -> CNO burning
- Core contracts, envelope expands
	- Surface T drops, opacity rises, envelope reaches into deep interior regions -> **DREDGE UP** 
- Star becomes a red giant
- He ignition
	- Radius decreases
	- Envelope stops being convective
- Core He burning -> 'blue loop'
- End of core He burning
	- Star becomes a giant with deep convective envelope
- Asymptotic Giant Branch
	- Early-AGB: Starts at the end of core He burning -> left with an inert CO core, shift to shell He burning, gradually adds mass to CO core, L increases as core grows
	- **SECOND DREDGE-UP** as expansion causes convective envelope to deepen again, ONLY for stars $>4M_\odot$ penetrates layers where H-burning took place
	- Thermally-Pulsing AGB: As He-shell burns, it runs out of fuel creating a H-He discontinuity, outer layers contract heating the H shell, H-burn starts again, making new He -> **double shell burning phase** -> NOT stable
		- Energy released expands outer layers, convective envelope reaches into intershell region -> **THIRD DREDGE UP**
	- Periodic runaway He burning, He shell flashes or THERMAL PULSES
	- Strong mass loss terminates the stars' evolution




**HIGH MASS STARS** ($M>8M_\odot$)
- Able to ignite [[Carbon Burning]], fusing up to iron (peak of [[Binding Energy Per Nucleon]] curve) ending lives in core-collapse supernova.
