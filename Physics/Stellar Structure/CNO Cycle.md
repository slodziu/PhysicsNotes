If C, N and O already present in a star, we can make Helium-4 another way:
- Protons captured by heavier nuclei
Distinctly two phased:
- [[CN cycle]]
- [[ON branch]]
- [[Energy]] generation $\varepsilon_{CNO}\propto T^{18}$, much higher than [[pp1]]
- Since more important at higher T, it's more important in more massive stars.
