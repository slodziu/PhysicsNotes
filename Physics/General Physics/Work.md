- The change in energy of system effected by changing its parameters (Volume etc.)\
- In thermodynamics, for a reversible change, a **frictionless** piston must move **slowly**.
- This means that $\def\dbar{{Â¯\mkern-12mu d}}$ $\dbar W = F\times x = -pA\frac{dV}{A}=-pdV$
- If changes not made slowly, the work will always be more than this quantity such that
$$\dbar W \geq-pdV$$
