The electron-positron collision yielding hadrons/muon-antimuon pair
Ratio of [[Cross-Section|cross-sections]] for the two events.
	$$R = \frac{\sigma(e^+e^-\to\text{hadrons})}{\sigma(e^+e^-\to\mu^-\mu^+)}=3\sum_qe^2_q/e^2=3\sum_qQ_q^2,$$
where $e_q$ is the electric charge of a quark, $Q_q$ is the fractional charge of each quark, summed over all quarks with mass less than energy of beam such that $m_q \leq E$. The factor of 3 accounts for all the three colour flavours each quark can have.
