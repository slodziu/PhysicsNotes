- Unstable nuclei decay to increase their [[Binding Energy Per Nucleon|BEPN]].
- $\alpha$: Special case of fission where $^4_2He$ nucleus is released.
- $\beta$ : $n\to p^+ + e^- + \bar{v}_e$ is $\beta^-$. As $m_n>m_p+m_e$, but very slightly, the decay is slow.
	$\beta^+$: $p^+\to n + e^+ + v_e$ 
	electron capture: $e^- + p^+ \to n + v_e$, proton captures an orbiting electron
- $\gamma$ : Nucleus releases a [[Photon|photon]] going into a lower [[Energy|energy state]].

- Lifetime of a 'resonance' using [[The Uncertainty Principle|UP]] is
$$t = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau},$$
where $\hbar$ is the [[Reduced Planck's Constant]] and $\tau$ is the 'resonance width'.
