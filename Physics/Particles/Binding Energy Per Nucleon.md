[[Binding Energy|Binding energy]] divided by mass number of the element.
To produce stable nuclei, [[Energy|energy]] is released. The curve of BEPN against A, has a maximum at iron, the most stable nucleus.
This means nuclei with less A will fuse together into heavier elements, nuclei with more A than iron will undergo fission to release energy.
