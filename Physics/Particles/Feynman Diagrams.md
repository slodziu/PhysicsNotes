- Tool used to calculate probability of event happening/ratio of probabilities
- Constructed using [[Vertex|vertices]]
- Conserves the usual quantities like [[Centre of Mass-Energy|centre of mass energy]] ($\sqrt{s}$).
- Each vertex has an associated coupling constant, depending on which force the interaction uses:
	- [[Electro-Magnetic Force|EM Force]], coupling constant is $g =Qe$, so the charge on the charged particle
		The [[Force Carrier|force carrier]] is a virtual [[Photon|photon]], which couples to **charged particles only**.

	- [[Strong Force]], $g = \sqrt{\alpha}$ ($\alpha =1/137$)
		[[Force Carrier|Carrier particle]] is the [[Gluon|gluon]], which couples only to quarks. Conserves charmness, strangeness etc.

	- [[Weak Force|Weak force]] has a complicated relationship with $g$, depending on the interacting particles and the mass of the carrier particle.
		Force carriers are $W^+, W^-$ and, $Z^0$ [[Bosons|bosons]], which have **mass** unlike any of the other carriers. Only interaction to produce neutrinos. Quark flavour **NOT conserved**. Same family quarks are **Cabibbo favoured** while different family quarks are **Cabibbo supressed** meaning there is a lower chance for $u\to s$ than $u\to d$.

- The Matrix Element, $M$ is proportional to the product of the coupling constants $M\propto\Pi\; g$ 
- Then the [[Cross-Section|cross-section]] is proportional to square of $M$ such that $\sigma \propto M^2$
- **Antiparticles go back in time axis**


Three possible channels of interaction:
- S-channel, in which 2 particles marge and produce an intermediate state that decays
- T-channel, in which 2 particles exchange an intermediate particle
- U-channel, similar to T-channel but final state particles are interchanged
