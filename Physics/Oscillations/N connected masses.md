- An intermediate between [[Coupled Oscillators|two coupled oscillators]] and [[Infinite chain of masses|infinite chain of coupled masses]]![[Pasted image 20231217145208.png]]
- Set of masses $m \in (1,2 \ldots, N)$ , then  if 'masses' $m=0$ and $m=N+1$ are walls instead, means they cannot move, so $A_0 = A_{N+1} = 0$, length of chain is $L = (N+1)a$.
- This gives solution with [[Angular Frequency|angular frequency]] $$\omega = 2\sqrt\frac{k}{M}sin(\frac{m\pi}{\lambda_n}), \tag1$$
where $m$ refers to index of mode and the [[Wavelength|wavelength]] is:
$$\lambda_n = \frac{2L}{m}. \tag2$$
