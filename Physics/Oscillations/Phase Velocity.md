- If a wave travels distance $a$ in time $2\pi a/\lambda\omega$ then it has phase velocity
$$v_p = \frac{\lambda}{T}=\frac{\omega}{k},$$
where $\lambda$ is the [[Wavelength|wavelength]], $T$ is the [[Period|period]], $\omega$ is the [[Angular Frequency|angular frequency]] and $k$ is the [[Angular Wavenumber|wavenumber]].
- If the phase velocity depends on wavelength, such that $v_p=v(k)$, then the wave is [[Dispersion Relation|dispersive]].
