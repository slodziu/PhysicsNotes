Then equations of motion:
$$m\ddot{x}_1(t) = -kx_1 -\kappa(x_1-x_2)$$ and
$$m\ddot{x}_2(t) = -kx_2 -\kappa(x_2-x_1)$$
- They are coupled as coordinate of one depends on the other.
- Can solve by 'decoupling': set $y_{-} = x_1 +x_2$ and $y_{+} = x_1 -x_2$
- Then solutions to decoupled equations with [[Angular Frequency|angular frequencies]] $\omega_{-} = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$ and $\omega_{+} = \sqrt{\frac{k + 2\kappa}{m}}$
