- Relates [[Angular Frequency|angular frequency]] to [[Wavelength|wavelength]] in a system
$$\omega = \omega(\lambda) \; \text{or}\; \omega(k)$$
- System non-dispersive if $\omega \propto 1/\lambda$. This means that the shape of the wave is preserved with time
	- Dispersive otherwise - this means that shape of the wave changes with time as each wave travels at different [[Phase Velocity|phase velocity]].
