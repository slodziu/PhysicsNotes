Extension of [[Coupled Oscillators|coupled oscillators]] to a case where $n \to \infty$ 
- Separation between particles = $a$ so the coordinate of $n$th particle is $x=na$, all masses $=m$ and springs stiffness $=k$.

Assuming the $n$th particle oscillates with amplitude $A_n = Csin(\frac{2\pi na}{\lambda}+\theta)$ , then monoatomic chain solution:
$$\omega = 2sin(\frac{\pi a}{\lambda})\sqrt{\frac{k}{M}}, \tag1$$
where $\lambda$ is the [[Wavelength|wavelength]]. This is a [[Dispersion Relation|dispersion relation]] for the chain of masses:

- Since this is a discrete system, the normal mode wavelength has a minimum value:
$$\lambda_{min} = 2a, \tag2$$therefore$$2a\leqslant\lambda<\infty.$$ so there is an upper limit on the frequencies of the modes.
- Since you can vary the phase of the wave, there are infinite waves one can construct with the same frequency. This leads to [[Degeneracy|degeneracy]].
