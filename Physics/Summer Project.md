- Research what topics there are resources for/what quality
- Identify Key/threshold concepts &  troublesome knowledge (within electromagnetism)
- choose subtopic within electromagnetism that has little resources/would benefit visualisation
- make animations in manim library in python (potentially to be used within lectures)
- use animations in lecture note-style environment as a standalone learning resource for students by using the animations as examples for the physics concepts (like Gauss' law)![[CircularOrbit.mp4]]
# Personal Statement
- Student rep - feedback from people so know what ppl struggle with
- Recently completed the course myself
- Good at programming (91% in numerical modelling part of course)
- Passionate about making a variety of learning resources for people to benefit from

Changes for brief:
- more impact for school
- condense 1st 2nd points for ultimate point of identifying the target of animations 'identify a topic where animations could be useful'
