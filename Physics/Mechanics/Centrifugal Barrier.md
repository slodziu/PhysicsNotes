The potential associated with the [[Centrifugal Force|centrifugal force]]:
$$U_{cf}(r)=\frac{L^2}{2mr^2},$$
where $L$ is the [[Angular Momentum|angular momentum]].
It is the part of the kinetic energy of the original particle associated with the component of the velocity perpendicular to the radius.
