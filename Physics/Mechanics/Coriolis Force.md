- [[Fictitious Force]] that arises due to a rotating frame of reference 
- Causes object’s motion to appear as a spiral
- Orthogonal to the velocity
- $\omega$ clockwise, $F_{cor}$ acts to the left of object’s motion, and vice versa
$$\vec{F_{cor}} = -2m\vec{\omega}\times\vec{v},$$
$$|\vec{F}_{cf}|=2m\omega v.$$
