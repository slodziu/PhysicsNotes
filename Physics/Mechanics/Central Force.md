- A force acting on a particle of form:
$$\vec{F} = \hat{r}f(r),$$
where $\hat{r}$ is the unit vector pointing towards the origin.

Key properties:
- [[Angular Momentum|Angular momentum]] around the centre is conserved as the [[Torque|torque]] is 0.
- This means that the particle's movement is confined to a two-dimensional plane.
- The particle moves in an [[Effective Potential|effective potential]] so the equation of motion becomes
$$m\frac{dr^2}{dt^2}=-\frac{d}{dr}U_{eff}.$$
