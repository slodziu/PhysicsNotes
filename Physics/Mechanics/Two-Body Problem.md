- Appears when two objects positions $\vec{r_1}$ and $\vec{r_2}$ interact and the force on each only depends on the distance between them.
- Force that acts on particle 1 by particle 2 is $\vec{F} = f(r)\hat{r}$.
- Redefine $\vec{r} = \vec{r_1}-\vec{r_2}$ , and the centre of mass positions as $$\vec{r}_{com} = \frac{m_1\vec{r_1} + m_2\vec{r_2}}{m_1 + m_2} \tag1$$
- This leads to a motion in a plane as a [[Central Force|central force]] problem.
- Then equations of motion are:
$$\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\vec{r}_{com} = 0, \mu\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\vec{r}=f(r)\hat{r}, \tag2$$
where $\mu$ is the [[Reduced Mass|reduced mass]] = $\frac{m_1m_2}{m_1+m_2}$.
