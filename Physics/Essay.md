# Intro
- ESA's 'Cosmic Vision' https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/ESA_s_Cosmic_Vision
- Cosmological Principle + FR equation - why was $\Lambda$ put in?
- Current standard model of cosmology is the accelerating cold dark matter paradigm (Λ-CDM)
- Evidence for dark matter are numerous, from varying probes: galaxy rotation curves, galaxy clusters, the cosmic microwave background

# Core Science:
• Measure constant and varying terms of equation of state of Dark Energy
• Test General Relativity at large scales, distinguish from modified gravity theories
• Constrain the sum of neutrino masses, through their imprint on structure formation
• Power spectrum of density perturbations, test inflation models

# Experiments:
- Galaxy Clustering
	- The baryons started to collapse in the potential well of dark matter and vice versa
	- Wiggle pattern imprinted on the correlation function of galaxies
- Weak gravitational lensing
	- Light from far away galaxies is deflected on its way to Earth.
	- The final shape of the galaxies will be slightly deformed.
	- Compare to Strong grav lensing
	- On average the intrinsic shape of galaxies is random
	- Averaging the shapes over a large population of galaxies, we can detect the imprint of the intervening mater
	- BARYON ACOUSTIC OSCILLATIONS - BAO
		- The primordial baryon-photon fluid oscillated due to perturbations • Sound waves • We have seen the imprint on the CMB power spectrum
		- At early epochs (z~3000), the photons, at the time coupled with baryons, would dampen the motion of baryons not allowing them to collapse in dark matter gravitational potentials
		- Any density perturbations would give rise to sound waves and baryons would oscillate at the speed of sound
		- At the time of decoupling (z~1000), the photons escaped and left behind the baryons frozen in space, creating atoms, and galaxies
		- This is created the primary peak at the CMB power spectrum
		- The scale depends on the speed of sound before decoupling
