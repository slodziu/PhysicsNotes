Despite different classifications of [[Active Galactic Nuclei]], a unified model exists in which different components of an AGN are always present but viewing from different angles.

The components of a unified AGN model are:

**Central Black Hole**:
- ~$10^7M_\odot$, potential energy provides accretion to fuel the AGN
**Accretion Disk**:
- Accretion very efficient so do not need a large accretion rate to power an AGN
**Jets and Lobes**:
- Radio emission from AGN comes from synchrotron from jets and lobes, jets travel at very relativistic speeds $\beta\approx0.999$
- *Doppler Boosting* -> if jets aligned with line of sight, only one side may be visible due to Doppler boosting, boosting *observed intensity* of the jet by ~1000x.
**Broad Line Region**:
- In optical spectra of quasars and Seyferts, line widths so large that thermal broadening would be impossible. Instead, line widths imply large bulk velocities, therefore gas clouds must be moving close to the black hole (within 1pc).
**Narrow Line Region**:
- Similar to broad lines, coming from gas moving around the central black hole, but further out, moving more slowly but still ionised by disk emission.
**Molecular Torus**:
- Quasar spectra show bump in IR not from disk or jets -> consistent with BB emission at 80K, originating from dusty torus that absorbs + reemits emission from nucleus.

Using this, considering angle $\theta$ to *jet axis*:
**Radio-Loud**:
- $\theta \to \pi/2$: Direct emission from disk and broad lines obscured by dusty torus.
- $\theta$ intermediate: Inner regions visible, as angle approaches jet axis, Doppler Boosting more significant
- $\theta \to  0$: Beaming of jet stronger, sources looks more compact. Observer sees emission from disk and broad + narrow lines, and synchrotron from jet.
- $\theta = 0$: Blazar, Doppler boosted jet emission drowns out emission lines.
**Radio-Quiet**:
- $\theta \to \pi/2$: Seyfert with narrow but no broad emission
- Intermediate $\theta$ to $\theta = 0$: Seyfert galaxy with broad and narrow emission lines.
