As the [[Electric Field|electrostatic field]] is conservative, its curl is the zero vector:
$$\mathbf{\nabla}\times \vec{E}=\vec{0}$$
The above equation holds only for **electrostatic** field.

This also implies that line integral of this field is independent of path:
$$\int_{closed \; path}\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{r} = 0$$
