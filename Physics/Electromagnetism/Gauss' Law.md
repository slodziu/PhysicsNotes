- Relates flux of an [[Electric Field|electric field]] through a surface the charge enclosed within.
$$\iint\vec{F}\cdot d\vec{S}=\frac{Q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0}$$
In differential form, can make use of the [[Continuous Charge Densities|continuous charge distribution]] along with the divergence theorem as $Q_{enc} = \iiint_V \rho(\vec{r})d\tau$ ;
$$\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot \vec{E}=\frac{\rho(\vec{r})}{\epsilon_0}$$
