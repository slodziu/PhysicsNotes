The charge contained in a line/surface/volume can be described by
$$Q=\iiint_V\rho d\tau=\iint_S\sigma dA=\int_l\lambda dx$$
Where $\rho, \sigma$ and $\lambda$ are the charge per unit volume/area/length respectively.

- $\sigma$ can be found from the [[Electric Potential|V]]:
$$\sigma = -\epsilon_0 \frac{\partial V}{\partial n},$$
where $$\frac{\partial V}{\partial n}= \mathbf{\nabla}V\cdot\hat{n}$$
