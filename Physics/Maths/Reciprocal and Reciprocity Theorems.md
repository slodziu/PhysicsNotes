- Let function $f(x,y,z)=0$
- Reciprocal theorem states that for partial derivatives:
$$(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x})_y=\frac{1}{(\frac{\partial x}{\partial z})_y}$$
- This works like 'normal' derivatives
- Reciprocity theorem states
$$(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x})_y(\frac{\partial x}{\partial y})_z(\frac{\partial y}{\partial z})_x=-1$$
- This can help obtain one partial derivative in terms of two others (with different constraints).
