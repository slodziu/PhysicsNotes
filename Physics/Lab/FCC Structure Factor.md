The [[face-centred cubic|FCC]] lattice is a Bravais lattice, and its Fourier transform is a body-centred cubic lattice.
$$F_{hk\ell} = f \sum_{j=1}^{4} \mathrm{e}^{[-2 \pi i (h x_j + k y_j + \ell z_j)]} = f \left[ 1 + \mathrm{e}^{[-i \pi (h + k)]}+ \mathrm{e}^{[-i \pi (k + \ell)]} + \mathrm{e}^{[-i \pi (h + \ell)]} \right] 
 =  f \left[ 1 + (-1)^{h + k} + (-1)^{k + \ell} + (-1)^{h + \ell} \right] $$
An example of this calculation is the [[Structure Factor Calculation for (200) plane of NaCl]], which yields $F_{200} = 87.08$

F_{hk\ell} =  \begin{cases} 4f, & h,k,\ell  \ \ \mbox{all even or all odd}\\
                         0, & h,k,\ell \ \  \mbox{mixed parity} \end{cases}
</math>The [[face-centred cubic|FCC]] lattice is a Bravais lattice, and its Fourier transform is a body-centred cubic lattice.  This leads to the general equation


$$
F_{hk\ell} =  \begin{cases} 4f, & h,k,\ell  \ \ \mbox{all even or all odd}\\
                         0, & h,k,\ell \ \  \mbox{mixed parity} \end{cases}

The most intense diffraction peak from a material that crystallizes in the FCC structure is typically the (111).   Films of FCC materials like gold tend to grow in a (111) orientation with a triangular surface symmetry.  A zero diffracted intensity for a group of diffracted beams (here, <math>h,k,\ell</math> of mixed parity) is called a systematic absence.
