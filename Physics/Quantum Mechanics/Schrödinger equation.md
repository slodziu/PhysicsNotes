- Given an initial condition, we can find state of the system for all times t.
$$i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2M}\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial x^2} + V(x)\psi(x,t)$$
Where $\hbar$ is the [[Reduced Planck's Constant]], V(x) is the potential encoding external forces.
- Solved using the [[Separation of variables]] technique assuming
$$\psi(x,t) = f(t)u(x)$$
- Which leads to the [[Schrödinger time equation]] and [[The Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation]]
- This means that the separable solutions have the form
