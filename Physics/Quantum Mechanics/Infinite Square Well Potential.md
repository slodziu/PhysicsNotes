Defined as $$
V(x) = 
\begin{cases}
  0, & x \in [0,a] \\
  \infty, & x<0 \;\text{or} \;x>a
\end{cases} \tag1
$$
so $a$ is the width of the well:

- Applying [[The Time-Independent Schr√∂dinger Equation|TISE]] to the three regions of the potential gives the general stationary states
$$u_n(x)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{a}}sin(\frac{n\pi x}{a})\tag2$$
- Particle in such well has [[Quantised|discrete]] energy levels associated with integers $n$:
$$E_n=\frac{\hbar^2\pi^2n^2}{2Ma^2}\tag3$$
- In general, eigenstates form an [[Orthonormal|orthonormal]] set of functions:
$$<u_m,u_n>=\delta_{m,n}$$
