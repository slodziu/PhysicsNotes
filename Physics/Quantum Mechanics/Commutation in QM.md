Using the [[Momentum Operator|momentum operator]] and [[Position Operator|position operator]] it can be seen that the operators do not commute, which means:
$$\hat{P}\hat{X}\psi(x)\neq 
\hat{X}\hat{P}\psi(x).\tag1$$
Indeed, the difference between the two is $$\hat{X}\hat{P}\psi(x)-\hat{P}\hat{X}\psi(x)=i\hbar \psi(x)\tag2$$
Therefore the [[Commutator|commutator]] of momentum and position
$$[\hat{X},\hat{P}]=i\hbar\tag3$$
This is known as the **canonical commutation relation**. Their incompatibility means that one cannot have a particle with both definite momentum and definite position at any time.
