- Force acting on particle $F(x)=-kx$.
- Approximating the potential of any well by the potential of this force such that
$$V(x)=\frac{1}{2}M\omega^2x^2\tag1$$ with $\omega = \sqrt{k/m}$
- For dimensionless coordinates, define $a = \sqrt{\hbar/M\omega}$, $y=x/a$ 
- This leads to form of [[The Time-Independent Schr√∂dinger Equation|TISE]] as:
$$\frac{d^2u}{dy^2}=y^2u(y)\tag2$$
so $$u(y)=Ae^{-\frac{1}{2}y^2}\tag3$$
This gives an energy eigenvalue of the **ground state** as $E_0 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega$. The general eigenstate using eq. 3 and definition of $a$ is
	$$u_n(x)=A_nv_n(\frac{x}{a})e^{-x^2/2a^2} \tag4$$with $v_n$ in $n$th degree polynomial alternating between even and odd.
The general energy levels of a quantum harmonic oscillator are given by
$$E_n = (n+\frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega\tag5$$
this shows that the **spacing between energy levels in constant** in a QH Oscillator.
