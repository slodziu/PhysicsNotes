- Combining the [[Momentum Operator|momentum operator]] and [[Position Operator|position operator]], it is defined as $$\hat{H} = \frac{\hat{P}^2}{2M}+\hat{V}(x)$$
- It is associated with the **total energy** of the system as the first term is the kinetic energy, and the second is the potential
- From this, the average total energy of a stationary state, $u(x)$ can be derived:
$$<H>=E$$
- Similarly, $<H^2> = E^2$ , so the standard deviation can be obtained $\Delta H = \sqrt{E^2-E^2} = 0$. 
- Since this operator is [[Hermitian|Hermitian]], this means that the energy $E$ in the eigenvalue equation of [[The Time-Independent Schr√∂dinger Equation|TISE]] must be real $E\in\mathbb{R}$.
