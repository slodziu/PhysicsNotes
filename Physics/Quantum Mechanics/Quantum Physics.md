- Probabilistic theory
- Photon energy [[Quantised]]
- Can **never** know the exact position and momentum.
- [[Wavefunction]] (spatial) of the form $$\psi(x, t)$$
- [[probability density function]] to find a particle at some position $x$ is: $$P(x) =|\psi(x,t)|^2. $$ $|\psi(x,t)|^2$ is the [[complex conjugate]] of $\psi(x,t)$ multiplied by $\psi(x,t)$
