- Phenomenon of QM where particle in a potential well **always must have some energy**.
- Taking the ground state of the [[Infinite Square Well Potential|infinite square well potential]] case, $E_1 =\frac{\hbar^2\pi^2}{2Ma^2}$. This is greater than the minimal potential energy ($E=0$).
- The reason for this is the [[The Uncertainty Principle|uncertainty principle]] as $\Delta p \geq \hbar/2\Delta x \geq \hbar/2a$
- This means that the particle has **range of momenta**, and therefore **range of kinetic energies**
