- Considering the [[Finite Square Well Potential|finite square well potential]], and particles with energy bigger than the potential step, such that $E_n \geq V_0$, particle approaching the well, will have its momentum changed suddenly.
- In QM, such particles always have a probability amplitude to be reflected from such a step, despite having more than enough energy to enter the region of the potential well.
- Almost complete opposite of the [[Quantum Tunnelling|tunnelling phenomenon]].
- If the momentum before is $p = \hbar k$ and $k$ is the [[Angular Wavenumber|wavenumber]], momentum after **transmission** is $p'=\hbar k'$, and momentum after reflection $p = -\hbar k$, then we can define reflection and transmission coefficients:
$$R =\frac{(k-k')^2}{(k+k')^2} \tag1$$
$$T = 1-R=\frac{4kk'}{(k+k')^2}\tag2$$
$k = \sqrt{2ME}/\hbar$, $k' = \sqrt{2M(E-V_0)}\hbar$.
