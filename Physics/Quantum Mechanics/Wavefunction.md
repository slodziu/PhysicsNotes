$\psi(x,t)$ or $\psi(p,t)$
- Fully specifies the state of a particle, has to be [[Normalisation|normalised ]], which is [[Conservation of normalisation|normalised in time]]. If not, apply the [[Wavefunction normalisation]] rule.
- Obeys the [[Superposition Principle]]
- Can be expressed as an infinite sum of eigenstates $u_n$ of the [[The Time-Independent Schr√∂dinger Equation|TISE]]:
$$\psi(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty c_nu_n$$
$$c_n = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}u^*_n(x)\psi(x)dx = <u_n, \psi>$$
$c_n$ is the [[Energy Probability Amplitude|energy probability amplitude]]
This is known as **completeness**
