- For **bound states** $0<E<V_0$ , the energy eigenvalues are $E_n = \hbar^2k_n^2/2M$, where $k_n$ are the intersection points of $tan(ka) = 2k\sqrt{k^2_0-k^2}/(2k^2-k^2_0)$ , and $k^2 = 2ME/\hbar^2$ and $k^2_0 =2MV_0/\hbar^2$.
- This can only be obtained numerically
- In finite square well, the energy levels are spaced closer than in the [[Infinite Square Well Potential|infinite square well]]:

- Nevertheless, the energy eigenstates have the following appearance:

It can be seen that some of the probability density extends beyond the barriers at $x=0, x=a$. This gives rise to [[Quantum Tunnelling|tunneling]].
